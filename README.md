<h1>Natours Project</h1>
<br>
<br>
<h3>Description</h3>
<br>
<p>This is my first npm packaged website with dependencies uploaded to github. This project incoprartes the user of SASS/SCSS CSS code for a more cleaner looking style. Used the BEM style of HTML class system for easy user readability. This project also includes seperation of code into parts and importing back to a main file called "main.scss"</p>
<br>
<p>This project was made in conjecuntion to a course I am taking on Udemy. This teaches moderen CSS design technicies to get myself used to more real world examples of sites that will need to be maintained. I also added variables and mixins for additional functionaility and ease to change things in the furture for potential updates. This landing page also includes responsive design accross multiple devices to ensure it looks stylish and functional no matter the screen size.</p>
